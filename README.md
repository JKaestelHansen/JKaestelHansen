## Hi there 👋
# 👋 Hi, I'm Jacob Kaestel Hansen

**Postdoctoral Fellow @ MIT | Bridging AI, Physics, and Biology**

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a postdoc fellow at MIT, passionate about pushing the boundaries between artificial intelligence, physics, and biology. My mission is to make machine learning not only powerful but also interpretable—especially for complex biological data with limited labels. I thrive on exploring explainable AI (XAI) and uncertainty estimation to unlock new insights from images, motion, and more.

- 🔬 **Research Focus:** Explainable AI & interpretability for biological data  
- 🧠 **Fun Project:** DeepSPT — applying deep learning to analyze biological motion  
- 🧑‍💻 **Always Coding:** Python, PyTorch, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning
